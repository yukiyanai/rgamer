## Overview

The goal of `rgamer` is to help students learn Game Theory using R.
The functions prepared by the package not only solve basic games such as two-person normal-form games but also provides the users with visual displays that highlight some aspects of the games --- payoff matrix, best response correspondence, etc.
In addition, it suggests some numerical solutions for games of which it is difficult --- or even seems impossible --- to derive a closed-form analytical solution.


## Installation

<!--
#You can install the released version of rgamer from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:
``` {r}
install.packages("rgamer")
```
-->

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("yukiyanai/rgamer")
```

or

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("yukiyanai/rgamer")
```


## Examples

```{r}
library(rgamer)
```

### Example 1

An example of a normal-form game (prisoner's dilemma).

- Player: \{Kamijo, Yanai \}
- Strategy: \{(Stays silent, Betrays), (Stays silent, Betrays)\}
- Payoff: \{(-1, 0, -3, -2), (-1, -3, 0, -2)\}

First, you define the game by `normal_form()`:
```{r}
game1 <- normal_form(
  players = c("Kamijo", "Yanai"),
  s1 = c("Stays silent", "Betrays"), 
  s2 = c("Stays silent", "Betrays"), 
  payoffs1 = c(-1,  0, -3, -2), 
  payoffs2 = c(-1, -3,  0, -2))
```

You can specify payoffs for each cell of the game matrix as follows.
```{r}
game1b <- normal_form(
  players = c("Kamijo", "Yanai"),
  s1 = c("Stays silent", "Betrays"), 
  s2 = c("Stays silent", "Betrays"), 
  cells = list(c(-1, -1), c(-3,  0),
               c( 0, -3), c(-2, -2)),
  byrow = TRUE)
```



Then, you can pass it to `solve_nfg()` function to get the table of the game and the Nash equilibrium.
```{r, message = TRUE}
s_game1 <- solve_nfg(game1, show_table = FALSE)
```

```{r, eval = TRUE, results = "asis"}
s_game1$table
```
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 4}
kableExtra::as_image(s_game1$table, 
                     width = 2.5)
```


### Example 2

An example of a coordination game.

- Player: \{Kamijo, Yanai \}
- Strategy: \{(Stag, Hare), (Stag, Hare)\}
- Payoff: \{(10, 8, 0, 7), (10, 0, 8, 7)\}

Define the game by `normal_form()`:
```{r}
game2 <- normal_form(
  players = c("Kamijo", "Yanai"),
  s1 = c("Stag", "Hare"), 
  s2 = c("Stag", "Hare"), 
  payoffs1 = c(10, 8, 0, 7), 
  payoffs2 = c(10, 0, 8, 7))
```

Then, you can pass it to `solve_nfg()` function to get NEs. Set `mixed = TRUE` to find mixed-strategy NEs well.
```{r, results = 'asis', message = TRUE}
s_game2 <- solve_nfg(game2, mixed = TRUE, show_table = FALSE)
```

For a 2-by-2 game, you can plot the best response correspondences as well.
```{r}
s_game2$br_plot
```



### Example 3

An example of a normal-form game:

- Player: \{ A, B \}
- Strategy: \{$x \in [0, 30]$, $y \in [0, 30]$ \}
- Payoff: \{$f_x(x, y) = -x^2 + (28 - y)x$, $f_y(x, y) = -y^2 + (28 - x) y$\}

You can define a game by specifying payoff functions as character vectors using `normal_form()`:
```{r}
game3 <- normal_form(
  players = c("A", "B"),
  payoffs1 = "-x^2 + (28 - y) * x",
  payoffs2 = "-y^2 + (28 - x) * y",
  par1_lim = c(0, 30),
  par2_lim = c(0, 30),
  pars = c("x", "y"))
```

Then, you can pass it to `solve_nfg()`, which displays the best response correspondences by default.
```{r, message = TRUE}
s_game3 <- solve_nfg(game3,)
```


### Example 4

An example of a normal-form game:

- Player: \{ A, B \}
- Strategy: \{$x \in [0, 30]$, $y \in [0, 30]$ \}
- Payoff: \{$f_x(x, y) = -x^a + (b - y)x$, $f_y(x, y) = -y^s + (t - x) y$\}

You can define a normal-form game by specifying payoffs by R functions.
```{r}
f_x <- function(x, y, a, b) {
  -x^a + (b - y) * x
}
f_y <- function(x, y, s, t) {
  -y^s + (t - x) * y
}
game4 <- normal_form(
  players = c("A", "B"),
  payoffs1 = f_x,
  payoffs2 = f_y,
  par1_lim = c(0, 30),
  par2_lim = c(0, 30),
  pars = c("x", "y"))
```

Then, you can approximate a solution numerically by `solve_nfg()`. Note that you need to set the parameter values of the function that should be treated as constants by arguments `cons1` and `cons2`, each of which accepts a named list. In addition, you can suppress the plot of best responses by `plot = FALSE`.
```{r, message = TRUE}
s_game4 <- solve_nfg(
  game = game4,
  cons1 = list(a = 2, b = 28),
  cons2 = list(s = 2, t = 28),
  plot = FALSE)
```

You can increase the precision of approximation by `precision`, which takes a natural number (default is `precision = 1`).
```{r, message = TRUE}
s_game4b <- solve_nfg(
  game = game4,
  cons1 = list(a = 2, b = 28),
  cons2 = list(s = 2, t = 28),
  precision = 3)
```

You can extract the best response plot with NE marked as follows.
```{r}
s_game4b$br_plot_NE
```


## Example 5

You can define payoffs by R functions and evaluate them at some discretized values by setting `discretize = TRUE`.  The following is a Bertrand competition example: 
```{r}
func_price1 <- function(p, q) {
  if (p < q) {
    profit <- p
  } else if (p == q) {
    profit <- 0.5 * p
  } else {
    profit <- 0
  }
  profit
}

func_price2 <- function(p, q){
  if (p > q) {
    profit <- q
  } else if (p == q) {
    profit <- 0.5 * q
  } else {
    profit <- 0
  }
  profit
}

game5 <- normal_form(
  payoffs1 = func_price1,
  payoffs2 = func_price2,
  pars = c("p", "q"),
  par1_lim = c(0, 10),
  par2_lim = c(0, 10),
  discretize = TRUE)
```

Then, you can examine the specified part of the game.
```{r, eval = TRUE, results = "asis"}
s_game5 <- solve_nfg(game5, mark_br = FALSE)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, message = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
s_game5 <- solve_nfg(game5, show_table = FALSE, mark_br = FALSE)
kableExtra::as_image(s_game5$table,
                     width = 4)
```




## Example 6

You can draw a tree of an extensive form game.
```{r, fig.width = 7}
game6 <- extensive_form(
  players = list("Yanai", 
                 rep("Kamijo", 2),
                 rep(NA, 4)),
  actions = list(c("stat", "game"),
                  c("stat", "game"), c("stat", "game")),
  payoffs = list(Yanai = c(2, 0, 0, 1),
                 Kamijo = c(1, 0, 0, 2)),
  direction = "right")
```

And you can find the solution of the game by `solve_efg()`.
```{r, message = TRUE}
s_game6 <- solve_efg(game6)
```

Then, you can see the path played under a solution by `show_path()`.
```{r, fig.width = 7}
show_path(s_game6)
```
